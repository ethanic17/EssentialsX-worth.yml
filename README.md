# EssentialsX-worth.yml
worth.yml Economy file for EssentialsX 2.18.0.0 (MC 1.16.1)

Still in a early stage, but this replaces the default worth.yml file located in EssentialsX 
to give your server a more stable economy. Only specific non-farmable/hard-to-obtain items 
can be sold to the server to prevent hyper-inflation. 

File tested on EssentialsX 2.18.0.0 on MC Paper Spgiot 1.16.1. Older versions are being tested
(1.15.2, 1.14.4, 1.13.2, 1.12.2) and are slated for release later. 

To install, replace the worth.yml file in the EssentialsX folder with the one in this repo, 
and then restart your server for effects to take place. 

Disclaimer: This specific economy is tailored for 1.16+ SMP Servers, and may not work well with
your specific server type or version.
